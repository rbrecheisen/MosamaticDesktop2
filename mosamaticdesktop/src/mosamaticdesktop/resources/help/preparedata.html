    <h3>Preparing your data</h3>
    <p>The current version of Mosamatic Desktop 2 is designed for analyzing CT images. CT is 
        still the most common imaging modality for analyzing body composition. Magnetic
        Resonance (MR) can also be used but takes more time to acquire and is not usually
        used for this purpose in the clinic.<br>
        <br>
        To be able to analyze muscle and fat tissue in CT images, we specify the following
        requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>Images have to be in DICOM format</li>
            <li>Only the image slice at the 3rd lumbar vertebral level (L3) can be used. If
                you have a full CT scan, you must select the L3 image slice first. Later 
                versions of Mosamatic Desktop 2 will support automatic slice selection to
                alleviate this process.
            </li>
            <li>Image size must ideally be 512 by 512. Mosamatic Desktop 2 can rescale the
                images to 512 by 512 if needed but can lead to slight loss of resolution.
            </li>
            <li>Images should ideally have been acquired with contrast during the portal 
                venous phase (PVP). Other phases, or no contrast, should also work but there
                may be slight differences in the resulting body composition metrics we 
                calculate. The conversion formulas for these other phases are linear 
                and known.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Manual selection of the L3 image slice in Weasis</h4>
        Image slice selection can be done in any DICOM viewer but we recommend the open-
        source tool Weasis. If you open the full scan in Weasis you can scroll to the L3
        image slice and write down its frame number (usually in the bottom left corner of the
        view). Then select File > Export > DICOM in the main menu. You will see an
        overview of all image slices in the scan. Uncheck all images except the one with the
        frame number you just wrote down. Then click "Export and Close". This will export the
        selected L3 image slice to file. The image will be stored in several sub-directories
        and the image file name will be some random piece of text. Rename this file to match
        the ID of the patient corresponding to this scan, and move the file to another directory
        so you keep all L3 image slices together.
