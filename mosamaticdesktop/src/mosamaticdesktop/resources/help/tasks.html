    <h3>Running individual tasks</h3>
    <p>Mosamatic Desktop 2 is a task-oriented tool. This means that you can run a sequence
    of tasks and have each task's output serve as input to the next task. You start by
    specifying the main input directory. Then you run your first task. This task will 
    process the images in the input directory and save the output results (which can be
    another set of images or something else) to its output directory. This output directory
    will be at the same level as the input directory and named according to the task's name.
    For example, if your main input directory is <b>D:\Mosamatic\Data\input</b>, and your first 
    task is called <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b> then this task's output directory will be
    <b>D:\Mosamatic\Data\decompressdicomfilestask</b>.</p>
    <p>Below we will describe the main workflow for analyzing muscle and fat in CT images
    at the L3 level. Keep this page open while you're going through the steps in the
    tool.</p>
    <h4>1. Specifying the main input directory</h4>
    In the top-level <b>Input</b> panel, click the <b>Select input directory</b> button
    and select the directory containing all your L3 image slices. This directory will
    then appear in the pull-down menu right below this button (see Figure 1).<br>
