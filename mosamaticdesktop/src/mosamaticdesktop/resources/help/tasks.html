    <h3>Running individual tasks in a basic workflow</h3>

    <p>Mosamatic Desktop 2 is a task-oriented tool. This means that you can run a sequence
    of tasks and have each task's output serve as input to the next task. You start by
    specifying the main input directory. Then you run your first task. This task will 
    process the images in the input directory and save the output results (which can be
    another set of images or something else) to its output directory. This output directory
    will be at the same level as the input directory and named according to the task's name.
    For example, if your main input directory is <b>D:\Mosamatic\Data\input</b>, and your first 
    task is called <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b> then this task's output directory will be
    <b>D:\Mosamatic\Data\decompressdicomfilestask</b>.</p>
    <p>Below we will describe the main workflow for analyzing muscle and fat in CT images
    at the L3 level. Keep this page open while you're going through the steps in the
    tool.</p>
    
    <h4>1. Specifying the main input directory</h4>
    
    In the top-level <b>Input</b> panel, click the <b>Select input directory</b> button
    and select the directory containing all your L3 image slices. This directory will
    then appear in the pull-down menu right below this button (see Figure 1).<br>

    <h4>2. Decompress DICOM files</h4>

    DICOM images are often stored with JPEG2000 compression. This is not a problem but Mosamatic
    Desktop 2 can only process uncompressed images. The <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b> task takes
    care of this. Any images that were not compressed will be copied without modification to the
    task's output directory.<br>
    <br>
    To run the <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b>, select it from the
    pull-down menu in the <b>Tasks</b> panel (see Figure 2). This task will use the previously
    specified main input directory for its input, i.e., the directory with your L3 images. If you
    want it to use another input directory, select it in the pull-down menu of the <b>Input</b>
    panel.<br>

    <i>Figure 2: Selecting task for decompressing DICOM files and setting its parameters</i><br>
    <br>
    After selecting the <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b>, click the <b>Set task parameters</b> button.
    This will allow you to configure the task's parameters (if any). Each task has a <b>Clean output</b>
    parameter that tells it to delete any existing output directories for the task, if it already
    exists. By default, the <b>Clean output</b> option is enabled. The <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b>
    does not have any other parameters to just click the <b>Save</b> button. This will enabled the
    <b>Run task</b> button. Click it to run the task. Based on the number of files in the main input
    directory, a progress bar will show the task's progress as a percentage (see Figure 3).<br>
    <br>

    <i>Figure 3: Showing progress of task</i><br>
    <br>
    When the <b>DecompressDicomFilesTask</b> task has finished, its output directory will be added to
    the pull-down menu of the <b>Input</b> panel and automatically selected so you can run the next
    task rightaway.<br>

    <h4>3. Rescale DICOM image to 512 by 512</h4>
    
    Mosamatic Desktop 2 can only process DICOM images that are 512 by 512 pixels in size. Sometimes 
    larger (often wider) images occur, for example, for obese patients that need a larger Field of View
    (FOV) to capture the full anatomy of the patient. For such images, Mosamatic Desktop 2 can perform
    a rescaling operation that first adds black space to the image to make it square, and then downscale
    the image to obtain an image of 512 by 512 pixels. The consequence of this operation is that you may
    lose a bit of resolution (the anatomy is covered by fewer pixels). The exact impact of this is not 
    completely known but it won't affect the mean gray values of the rescaled image, only the surface
    areas of the muscle and fat regions (slightly).<br>
    <br>
    The input directory for this task can be selected in the main input panel's pull-down menu.<br>
    <br>
    Figure 4 shows selection of the RescaleDicomFilesTask and its parameters. The target size is set to
    512 by default and should stay that way for Mosamatic Desktop 2.

    <h4>4. Automatic annotation of muscle and fat</h4>

    After decompressing and rescaling the L3 images (if needed), you are now ready to run the automatic
    muscle and fat annotation on the images. Figure 5 shows this task's parameters. The first thing to
    do is select the model type. This refers to the AI model that you plan to use. By default it is set
    to "tensorflow". An alternative is "torch" which is an AI model for L3 muscle and fat annotation using
    a PyTorch-based AI model. This model is still work in progress though and does not give the exact
    same results as the TensorFlow model so use "tensorflow" for now.<br>
    <br>
    The input directory for this task can be selected from the main input panel's pull-down menu and is
    probably the output directory of the previous task (RescaleDicomFilesTask).<br>
    <br>

    <i>Figure 5: Task parameters for muscle and fat annotation</i><br>
    <br>
    Annotating muscle and fat in the L3 images will take some time. Please check the progress bar for 
    indication how far the AI model has progressed. The outputs of this task is a set of NumPy arrays
    that contain the labels specifying which tissue each pixel belongs to (most likely), i.e., muscle,
    subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.<br>

    <h4>5. Calculation of body composition metrics</h4>

    After automatically annotating muscle and fat in the L3 images, you will have segmentation outputs
    that specify the muscle, subcutaneous fat and visceral fat regions. A number of metrics can be calculated
    for these regions namely:
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle area</li>
        <li>Mean muscle radiation attenutation</li>
        <li>Subcutaneous fat area</li>
        <li>Mean subcutaneous fat radiation attenutation</li>
        <li>Visceral fat area</li>
        <li>Mean visceral fat radiation attenutation</li>
    </ul>
    The area metrics are calculated by taking the area of each pixel (in mm^2) and summing the areas of
    all pixels inside the area. This is done for muscle, subcutaneous fat and visceral fat separately. The
    radiation attenutation metrics are calculated by summing the Hounsfield Unit values of all pixels inside the
    area and dividing by the number of pixels in that area. This is done for muscle, subcutaneous fat
    and visceral fat.<br>
    <br>
    The input directory for this task can be selected from the main input panel's pull-down menu and will 
    be the output directory of the previous task (MuscleFatSegmentationTask).<br>
    <br>
    The parameters for the CalculateMetricsTask are shown in Figure 6. Using the button <b>Open image directory</b>
    you can select the directory containing the L3 images. This will probably be the output directory of either
    the DecompressDicomFilesTask or RescaleDicomFilesTask. The input directory for this task should be selected
    in the main input directory pull-down menu and refer to the output directory of the MuscleFatSegmentationTask.<br>

    <h4>6. Generating PNG images of muscle and fat segmentations</h4>

    To be able to look at the output of the MuscleFatSegmentationTask, it makes sense to convert these outputs
    to PNG images for easy viewing. This can be done with the CreatePngsFromSegmentationsTask. It takes the
    NumPy array objects created with the MuscleFatSegmentationTask and convert these to PNG. In the task 
    parameters (see Figure 7) you can specify the width and height of the resulting figure.<br>
