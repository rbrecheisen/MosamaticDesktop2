    <h3>Background and motivation</h3>
    <p>Body composition analysis, i.e., measurement of changes in muscle and fat tissue, 
        is increasingly important in clinical research and applied medicine, especially 
        for patients with obesity, diabetes, cancer and general old age.<br>
        <br>
        Assessment of muscle and fat loss in the human body has traditionally been done 
        using weight or Body Mass Index (BMI). Weight in kilograms, however, is a very 
        subjective, mostly self-reported measurement. BMI can offer insights into the health 
        of a larger population but is not suitable for individual assessment of body 
        composition given the fact that it does not distinguish between muscle or fat. 
        It is also based on weight, which includes both muscle, fat, bone and organs.<br>
        <br>
        For individual assessment of muscle and fat tissue, Computed Tomography (CT) imaging 
        is currently the gold standard. Most patients with severe obesity (eligible for 
        bariatric surgery), diabetes and cancer are regular visitors to the hospital and 
        will have undergone CT imaging as part of routine clinical care. Due to ionizing 
        radiation exposure CT imaging is not regularly performed on healthy subjects.<br>
        <br>
        In recent years, muscle and fat tissue visible on CT images acquired at the 3rd 
        lumbar vertebral level (L3) has been shown to be the best representation of muscle
        and fat mass in the whole body [refs]. Note that [refs] do not say anything about 
        muscle and fat tissue quality at L3 and its relation to the whole body.<br>
        <br>
        The most widely used software tool for calculating muscle and fat area at L3, 
        and the mean radiation attenuation (in Hounsfield units) in these areas, has 
        been Tomovision sliceOmatic. This tool can delineate muscle and fat tissue at 
        L3 semi-automatically but requires time-consuming manual corrections before the 
        delineations can be used for calculating area and mean HU values. Manual 
        correction requires about 10-15 minutes depending on the expertise of the user.<br>
        <br>
        The Surgery Research Group of Maastricht University has used sliceOmatic for more 
        than 10 years and has thereby collected a large dataset of expert-corrected L3 
        images. This dataset comprised >3400 patients in 2018. Together with Maastro Clinic
        in Maastricht we developed an AI model that used this dataset for training and testing,
        in order to automatically perform the delineation of muscle and fat in L3 images 
        without futher need of manual correction. This AI model was subsequently validated 
        externally on another large dataset of >2500 patients from the University of Glasgow. 
        The validation results were extremely good and we published a paper about the AI 
        model and its external validation in the British Journal of Radiology in 2014 
        (see citation on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>).
